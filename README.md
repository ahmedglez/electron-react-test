# Title: React Electron Technical Test

> This is a technical test for a React Electron Developer position. The test is to create a simple electron app that has a tow counters, the first counter is a linear counter that can be incremented and decremented, the second counter is a variable counter that can be configure by a min and max value and can be incremented and decremented. The app should also have a reset button that resets the counters to their initial state.

> This project was bootstrapped from [electron-typescript-react-tailwind-redux](https://github.com/saucesteals/electron-typescript-react-tailwind-redux.git) template.
